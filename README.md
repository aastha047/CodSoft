#CodSoft

This is my CodSoft Internship project! This repository contains the work I have done during my internship at CodSoft. 

The project focuses on python programming.

In this project, I have completed three tasks-
- To-do List Application
- Simple Arithmetic Calculator
- Password Generator Application

Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunity to work with such a supportive team at CodSoft and look forward to applying these skills to future projects.
